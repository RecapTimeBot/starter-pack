# Documentation homepage

Welcome to the documentation page for maintainers, contributors and regular users alike!
Since we're moving these documentation into [its new home](https://github.com/code-server-boilerplates/docs), we'll completely remove the cntents of `docs` directory excluding this one and the `guides` symlink as we'll move the deployment dcs stuff int a single document in the [`DEPLOY.md`](../DEPLOY.md) and its post-repository creation checklist at [`POST_REPO_CREATION_CHECKLIST.md`](../POST_REPO_CREATION_CHECKLIST.md).
