# Packages Directory

This subdirectory in `toolkits` is just an example for
the documentation on how to copy files into an Docker image, somewhere under the
`@rtapp-non-thejuice-media-refs/*` stuff.

For the source files in the `~/.bashrc_d` directory on the container, navigate to the [`dotbashrcdir`](dotbashrcdir) folder. Everything else are at [the scripts folder](scripts)
